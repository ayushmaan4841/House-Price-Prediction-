# House Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model built using **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, garage spaces, number of floors, year built, and a location score. The project is implemented in **Python** using the **Scikit-learn** library.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one with the necessary libraries:

```bash
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
```

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

- `area`: Total area of the house in square feet.
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.
- `garage`: Number of garage spaces.
- `floors`: Number of floors.
- `year_built`: Year the house was constructed.
- `location_score`: A custom score representing the desirability of the house's location (on a scale of 1-10).
- `price`: The target variable representing the price of the house.

For demonstration, the dataset used is simulated, but you can easily replace it with a real-world dataset by loading it from a CSV file.

# Features

The model is trained on the following features:

- **area**: The total area of the house (in square feet).
- **bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms.
- **bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms.
- **garage**: Number of garage spaces.
- **floors**: Number of floors.
- **year_built**: Year when the house was constructed.
- **location_score**: A numerical score reflecting the quality of the house’s location.

# Model

The machine learning model used in this project is **Linear Regression** from **Scikit-learn**. The model predicts house prices based on the features listed above.

## Steps in the Model:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical data if necessary.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model using the training dataset.
3. **Prediction**: Predict house prices for the test dataset or for new input data.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error** and **R² score**.

# Usage

1. Ensure you have installed the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Run the Python script to train the model and predict house prices. For example:

   ```bash
   python house_price_prediction.py
   ```

3. To predict house prices for new data, you can modify the `new_data` array in the script and rerun it. Example:

   ```python
   new_data = [[3200, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2017, 8]]  # area, bedrooms, bathrooms, garage, floors, year_built, location_score
   predicted_price = model.predict(new_data)
   print("Predicted Price:", predicted_price)
   ```

# Evaluation

The model’s performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual prices.
- **R² Score**: Represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The closer the R² score is to 1, the better the model.

Sample output might look like this:

```
Mean Squared Error: 1000000000.0
R^2 Score: 0.95
Predicted Prices: [450000.0, ...]
```
